Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
- Within this file are two functions. The initial function is:
  - processArray: It accepts an array of numbers and produces a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.
Task 2: 
- The subsequent function within arrayManipulation.js is:
  - formatArrayStrings: It operates on two arrays - a string array and a number array processed by "processArray". This function adjusts each string based on its corresponding number - capitalizing the entire string for even numbers and converting it to lowercase for odd numbers.
Task 3: userInfo.js
- This script introduces a function named "createUserProfiles", which takes a list of names and the modified names array from "arrayManipulation.js". It yields an array of objects, each comprising originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id (beginning from 1).
